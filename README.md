# Volvo Matchmaker (Proof of concept)

Hackathon project to help you choose the right car: Go through a series of question, find the right car and ask any question you have about it.

This implementation is a proof of concept. We used this version as the backbone of the final product.

## Getting Started

You need `ollama` installed.
I'm using Phi4 model for responding to questions about the selected car models: `ollama pull phi4`
Then, run the development server: `npm run dev`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
